    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Gabriel Dargains, a 26 years old programmer, sound designer and researcher. I've graduated in piano performance and did masters in creative processes in Unirio (in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), where I'm also working on my PhD research. I've been teaching, playing live and working on audio productions for plays and videogames but I'm starting to shift my career somewhere else.</p>
    <p>I started programming for assignments on musical presentations and learned the basics of programming languages through Pure Data and Csound. Now I'm putting some time in learning Python, Javascript, Css, Html to work as a Web Developer.</p>
    <p>I love different kinds of art, such as music, literature, movies, games and also passionate about tasting food and tea! I'm very eclectic and eager to try out new things. I'm hardly ever bored and very quick to pick up new skills. Some of my hobbies include reading and playing tabletop roleplaying games. </p>
